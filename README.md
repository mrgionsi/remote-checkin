    cd remote-checkin
    ```

2.  **Configure Environment Variables:**

    Create a `.env` file in the root directory and populate it with the necessary environment variables:

    ```
    DB_HOST=<your_database_host>
    DB_PORT=<your_database_port>
    DB_USER=<your_database_username>
    DB_PASSWORD=<your_database_password>
    DB_NAME=<your_database_name>
    DATABASE_TYPE=<your_database_type> # e.g., postgresql

    MAIL_SERVER=<your_mail_server>
    MAIL_PORT=<your_mail_port>
    MAIL_USERNAME=<your_mail_username>
    MAIL_PASSWORD=<your_mail_password>
    MAIL_DEFAULT_SENDER=<your_default_sender_email>

    # Other necessary environment variables...
    ```
    Refer to `backend/EMAIL_CONFIG.md` and other configuration files for a comprehensive list of required variables.

3. **Install the project dependencies:**

    ```bash
    # Backend Python dependencies
    $ pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
    # Frontend Node.js dependencies
    $ cd frontend && npm install
    ```

4.  **Build and Run with Docker Compose (Recommended):**

    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
